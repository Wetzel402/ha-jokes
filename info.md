# Jokes Integration

Bring some humor to your Home Assistant setup with random jokes from multiple sources!

## What it does

This integration fetches random jokes from up to five different joke APIs and makes them available as a sensor in Home Assistant. It randomly selects which provider to use and includes fault tolerance to automatically try alternative providers if one fails. It also **ships its own Lovelace card**.

## Key Features

- 🎭 **Multiple Joke Sources**: Fetches from icanhazdadjoke.com, JokeAPI v2, and Official Joke API — plus Geek Jokes and Yo Mama, which serve unfiltered adult/edgy content and are **opt-in only**
- 🃏 **Bundled Lovelace Card**: `custom:ha-jokes-card` is included and auto-registered — nothing extra to install, no resource to add by hand. Just pick **"Jokes Card"** in the card picker
- 🔀 **Random Selection**: Providers are randomly selected for variety
- 🛡️ **Fault Tolerance**: Automatically tries alternative providers if one fails
- 📊 **Sensor Entity**: Clean integration with Home Assistant's sensor platform
- 🏷️ **Rich Attributes**: Joke text, unique ID, source, and metadata stored as attributes
- ⏰ **Configurable Updates**: Set refresh interval from 1 minute to 24 hours
- ⚙️ **Easy Setup**: Simple configuration through the Home Assistant UI, including JokeAPI filters and Official Joke API categories
- 🔄 **Options Flow**: Change settings without removing and re-adding the integration
